206,Opedia,HOT221_247_14C_PP_EOC,Time-series rates of dissolved organic carbon production in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean,,"Matthew  Church, Univ Montana",,"Over a 3-year period (April 2010-April 2013), we measured 14C-DOC production from vertical profiles used for determination of 14C-particle production, utilizing 0.2 mm filtrates. Seawater for these experiments was collected from predawn CTD hydrocasts into acid-cleaned 500-ml polycarbonate bottles. A total of four replicate 500 ml bottles were subsampled per depth and each bottle was spiked with ~1.85 MBq 14C-bicarbonate. One hundred milliliters from one replicate per depth was vacuum filtered through a 0.2 mm polycarbonate filter and the filtrate served as a time zero blank. The remaining three bottles were hung on a free-drifting array, deployed before dawn, and incubated at their initial collection depths throughout the photoperiod (typically 11-13 hours). After sunset the array was recovered, and 100 ml subsamples of all bottles were filtered under gentle vacuum (<50 mm Hg) onto 0.2 mm polycarbonate filters. These 0.2 mm filtrates were stored frozen (-20oC) until subsequent processing for determination of 14C-DOC productivity. Samples were processed as follows: 100 ml of the 14C-PC filtrates were thawed, poured into 500 ml polyethylene separatory funnels, and acidified by the addition of 500 µl of 2 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Samples were vigorously bubbled with air in a fume hood to remove 14CO2. A 70 ml subsample was removed from each separatory funnel and poured into a 100 ml glass serum bottle containing 1 ml of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 10 ml of 0.37 M potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) in 1 M NaOH. Bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers, crimp sealed with an aluminum cap, and autoclaved at 126°C for 200 minutes; oxidizing 14C-DOC to 14C-DIC in an alkaline solution. Once cooled to room temperature, samples were uncapped and resealed using rubber sleeve stoppers holding plastic center wells containing ~2 x 2 cm pieces of fluted chromatographic filter paper (Whatman 2) soaked with 0.2 ml of ß-phenylethylamine. A syringe was used to inject 4 ml of 9 N H2SO4 into the solution, converting the 14C-labeled dissolved inorganic carbon (hereafter 14C-DIC) to 14CO2. Samples were stored undisturbed at room temperature, passively trapping the 14CO2 on the ß-phenylethylamine soaked wick. After at least 100 hours, rubber sleeve stoppers were removed and center wells and wicks were placed in scintillation vials, followed by the addition of 10 ml of Ultima Gold LLT scintillation cocktail. Samples were subsequently counted on a Perkin Elmer Tri-Carb 2800TR liquid scintillation counter. Rates of 14C-DOC production were computed for each cruise as the mean of the triplicate bottles from each depth minus the average 14C-activity of the time zero (blank) samples.",False,This work was funded by the Simons Foundation through the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE award #329108 to M.J.

The mission design consisted of ascension from 1000-m depth to surface twice a day, at ~local noon and local midnight. The float provided its last profile on October 25, 2019, when batteries were exhausted. At each surfacing event, the optode collected measurements in air (~ 25 cm above sea surface) to allow post-calibration. Raw float oxygen optode data were corrected for pressure and salinity following Uchida et al. \[2008] and Garcia and Gordon \[1992]. Float optode oxygen data were calibrated using optode air measurements taken at the time of each float surfacing following methods described in Bushinsky et al. \[2016]. Briefly, air calibration relies on the estimate of a gain factor G, such that O2_corrected = G×O2_raw. In practice, G is an average gain factor for each float profile determined from the ratio of the expected partial pressure of oxygen in air (pO2) to the partial pressure of oxygen in air measured by the optode (pO2_optode), i.e. gi=pO2/pO2_optode. Optode air measurements were first filtered to remove outliers (e.g. measurements taken underwater or with high variance), and mean values per surfacing were recorded. pO2_optode was calculated from optode phase and temperature as in the Aanderaa Manual. Atmospheric pO2 was calculated as in Bushinsky et al. \[2016] using float-derived water vapor pressure estimates (pH20) at the time of each float surfacing (Aanderaa Manual) as well as the 6-h NOAA NCEP atmospheric pressure and surface relative humidity data interpolated to the time and location of each float surfacing. An average G value of 1.30 was then calculated based on the gi estimates from each surfacing at each station, and applied to all optode profiles. Gain-corrected oxygen concentration and saturation data were not calibrated against Winkler measurements, and therefore variables are noted as being ""uncalibrated"". Potential density was calculated using the Gibbs gsw_sigma0.m function in Matlab. Chlorophyll fluorescence was converted to chlorophyll concentrations by first subtracting a deep-value (average at ~980m depth) and applying the factory scaling factor. The volume scattering coefficient was calibrated by subtracting a dark value obtained on ship deck prior to deployment, and applying the factory scaling factor. Volume scattering coefficient was converted to particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp, the product provided in this dataset) using the approach of  Zhang et al \[2009] to obtain backscattering due to seawater, and then by using the approach of Boss and Pegau \[2001] to obtain bbp, assuming a X factor of 1.1 (see  Boss and Pegau \[2001]).

Samples were corrected for a DI water blank and a reagent standard curve (4 concentrations for both SRP and N+N) that was run for about 10 min every few hours.  For this cruise, only the data for the return leg is provided for SRP, as the instrument was not working optimally during the northbound leg.

The specific goal in these observations was to observe diel patterns in transcript abundance in planktonic bacteria, archaea and phage, in adjacent cyclone and anticyclonic eddies. Picoplankton, >0.2um filtered cell were collected every four hours over the course of 8 days, while tracking a Langrangian float to consistently sample the same water mass.  An internal standard RNA control was added, RNA was extracted, ribosomal RNAs were removed/depleted from the extract, and metatranscriptomes of cDNA libraries from the cell fraction were sequenced.  These data are being used to understand differential transcript abundances and physiological states of picoplankton in cyclonic versus anticyclonic eddies.

Temperature and Salinity measurments were collected from a SBE-21 Seacat Thermosalinograph (TSG) at 10 second intervals. Navigation data (time, lat, lon) are recorded from shipboard GPS at minute resolution. These records are then linearly interpolated to match the 10 second resolution from the TSG. While most TSG data are from the HOT cruise series, this dataset also includes TSG data from the ALOHA-Climax (AC) cruise series and the HALE ALOHA (HA) cruises.

At select stations a secondary set was collected and size fractionated using a 3um polycarbonate filter to provide the <3um size fraction of PP and PCPN. Following filtration, filters for PCPN were folded in half and placed in combusted aluminum foil and stored at -80°C for later analysis. Post-cruise, all filters were thawed and dried overnight at 60°C. Samples were then balled into Ag and Sn boats and plated for analysis. Organic carbon and total nitrogen content was analyzed using high-temperature combustion (1020 C) on a ThermoQuest NC 2500 elemental analyzer. Three standards with known %C and %N were weighed, folded in tin boats, and analyzed with the samples to develop the calibration equation for each run. The calibration equation was then used to calculate the mass (mg) of carbon and nitrogen in each sample using EAS Clarity Chromatography Station software. The standards are Cystine (Elemental Microanalysis, B2035, 11.66 %TN, 29.99 %TC), Atropine (Elemental Microanalysis, B2002, 4.84 %TN, 70.56%TC), and GoniLab Secondary Standard (low %C)-A1 (an internal standard of sediment from the Gulf of Mexico, MV0803, with low carbon - 0.12 %N, 1.3 %C). Following filtration, PP filters were placed in histoprep capsules and stored at -80°C for later analysis. Post-cruise, all filters were thawed overnight, combusted at 450°C for 4.5 hours, then extracted with 0.15 M HCl for 1 hour at 60°C. PP was then analyzed spectrophotometrically as SRP in a 1.0 cm cell at 880 nm following Strickland and Parsons (1972). Recovery efficiency was assessed from the analysis of a known dry weight of certified reference material (National Institute of Standards, NIST 1515, apple leaves, certified 0.159% P by weight).
